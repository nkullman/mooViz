# MOO Viz
### Extract more information from multi-objective optimization results

**MOO Viz** exists to help visualize and understand Pareto-optimal point sets, specifically, those produced by solving multi-objective math programming models.

To compare these point sets (*frontiers*) MOO Viz can produce a handful of visualization aids, from simple tables to scatterplots to parallel coordinate plots. MOO Viz also computes metrics that describe the competition between frontiers in a dataset and between objectives within a frontier. The metrics include a pairwise-objective conflict score (described in Section 2.4 [here](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/38212/Kullman_washington_0250O_16651.pdf)), the hypervolume indicator, and other measures most commonly used in evolutionary multi-objective optimization.
