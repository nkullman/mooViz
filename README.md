# MOO Viz
###Extract more information from your multi-objective optimization results

**MOO Viz** exists to help visualize and understand Pareto-optimal point sets, specifically, those produced by solving multi-objective math programming models.

To compare these point sets (*frontiers*) MOO Viz can produce a handful of visualization aids, from simple tables to scatterplots to parallel coordinate plots. MOO Viz also computes metrics that describe the competition between frontiers in a dataset and between objectives within a frontier. The metrics include correlation coefficients, the hypervolume indicator and other measures commonly used in evolutionary multi-objective optimization.

*Note: only a small subset of the eventual features are currently implemented. Please check back (or contribute!) for updates.*
